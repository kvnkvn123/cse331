Problem 6.

(a) Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test 
because it initially threw an exception when asked to generate the 
0th Fibonacci term (fib.getFibTerm(0)), which is non negative and
should be generated since this series starts at a zero index. To
fix this, I had to change the IllegalArgumentException test of 
the getFibTerm method from if (n <= 0) to if (n < 0).


(b) Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because it threw
an IllegalArgumentException for the base case zero. This 
was also fixed by the change mentioned in the answer about, by
changing the IllegalArgumentException test of
the getFibTerm method from if (n <= 0) to if (n < 0).


(c) Fibanacci failed the testInductiveCase test for a number
of reasons; it threw an exception for the 0th fibonacci
number, it calculated 1 and 2 as the base cases, and its
recursive definition was wrong (it subtracted instead of
added the previous two fibonacci numbers. So, apart from the
change mentioned in the previous two answers, I had to
change the else if test (base cases) to else if (n < 2),
and I needed to change the else test (recursive case) 
from getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2) to
getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2). 


Problem 7. 

Changes made in Ball:
(a) Changed volume method to assign argument value to this.volume
so that the class field would be updates
(b) Changed the return value in getVolume() from 0 to this.volume,
so accurately return the volume of the ball
