Describe which parts of your code belong to the model, the view,
the controller, or none of these.  (See the assignment for details.)

Model:
1. Point.java : to represent locations; java's built-in Point 
	is poorly designed, not generic
2. Building.java : used to represent buildings
3. CampusPathModel.java : class of the model that manages graph
4. Graph.java 
5. Edge.java
6. WeightedPath.java
7. MarvelPath2.java implements Dijkstra's algorithm

View / Controller : CampusPathCLI.java.
Within this class, methods that implement view:
1. printMenu
2. printBuildings
3. printPath (every part except line 112-113
4. getDirection : while this class does do calculations, I argue
	that it is used to transform model data into the appropriate view 
	by determining directions. It could be argues that it should be
	part of the model as well, it is slightly ambiguous
5. main is also a part of the view, though it is mostly part of the controller

Methods that implement controller:
1. CampusCLI.main
2. printPath (the part which communicated with model to find shortest path)
	Line 112-113

The classes WeightedPath, Building and Point<E> are used to convey information
about paths and buildings and locations between the model, view and controller 
and internally. I have listed them as part of the model, but they can be seen
as connecting classes as well.
