Problem 0.

(a) We use the polynomial addition previously defined in the example.
(This addition returns a new polynomial)
We also assume that we can set a polynomial equal to a given term
Pseudocode:
r = p * q:
	set r = 0;
	for each term t_p in p:
		for each term t_q in q:
			// note temp is a polynomial
			set temp = t_p * t_ q;
			// this is polynomial addition
			r = r + temp;


(b) Let degree(a) be a function that returns the degree of
the polynomial a.
Psuedocode:
q = u / v:
	set remainder = u by making a term by term copy of all terms in u
	set q = 0;
	while (degree(remainder) >= degree(v)):
		set t1 = term with largest degree in remainder
		set
