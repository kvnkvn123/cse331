1) List any changes made to the hw8 model implementation for hw9 or 
"none" if no changes were made.  If there are any changes, include
a short explanation of each change and why it was needed (see the
assignment for details of what to include here).

No changes to actual model implementation. Made a minor change
to Buildings class, which is a class used to convey building 
information. I created a toString() method for display of a building
in a JComboBox, so that I could have a JComboBox<Building> and
easily convey building selection informaiton


2) List any additional (optional) extra features included in your
hw9 GUI or "none" if no additional features.

1. Map resizes to fit window. However, the menu does not always
 fit in all the buttons at small sizes, so its size needs to be 
 above a certain minimum. 
2. Map zooms in to path when user asks to find path
3. Displays the distance to the user on a label
