Problem 1. (Written exercises)

(a) 1. IntQueue1
	
	Representation Invariant:
		entries != null 
		
	Abstraction Function:
		AF(r) represents a queue of integers q such that
		if q is empty, r.entries = []
		otherwise, for q = [n1, n2, ..., n_k] of size k
		n_i = r.entries.get(i - 1)   for 0 < i <= k


(b) 2. IntQueue2

	Representation Invariant:
		entries != null &&
		size >= 0 && size <= entries.length &&
		front >= 0 && front < entries.length 
		
	Abstraction Function:
		AF(r) represents a queue of integers q such that
		size of the queue = r.size
		for nonempty q = [n1, n2, ..., n_k] of size k
		n_i = r.entries[(front+1)%(r.entries.length)]  for 0 < i <= k
