# Tests that a graph can be created, and edges can be
# added between existing nodes and between previously
# nonexistent nodes. Test adding the same edge (graph
# should not change) and adding edges between nodes
# that already have edges between them (edge should be
# added.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add another node
added node n2 to graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# list children of n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)

# list children of n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are:

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# list children of n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)

# list children of n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are:

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Add an edge
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# list children of n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)

# list children of n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are:

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Add an edge
added edge e3 from n3 to n4 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4

# list children of n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)

# list children of n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are:

# list children of n3
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n4(e3)

# list children of n4
the children of n4 in graph1 are:

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
