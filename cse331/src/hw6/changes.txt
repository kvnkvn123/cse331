Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

1. Major change: I changed the public interface in a few different ways
 1: I changed the visibility of my edge objects from a private nested class
 	to a protected nested class. The constructor is still private, so
 	edges cannot be created outside the graph class, but i realized that 
 	having an immutable object
 	that represents edge data is useful for clients.
 	
 2. I changed some of the methods in the GeneralGraph interface (and Graph
 	class) I converted getChildren to getConnectedNodes(since this
 	interface could be used for a non-directed graph) and I included this
 	in the GeneralGraph interface since this seems to be a useful method
 
 3. I changed the getEdgesFrom() method in the interface to a method in
 	the graph implementation only. Then, I allowed this method to
 	return edges. I did not keep this as part of the interface since I
 	wanted the interface to allow implementations that do not use
 	edge objects.
 
 4. I changed the original geEdgesFrom method() to a getStringEdgesFrom()
 	method that returns the edges in string form, facilitating the
 	format specified in the HW5 test driver.
 	
 Problem 3:
 Note on testing: I created specification tests that test for edge cases
 by catching exceptions, so i did not need to create implementation tests
